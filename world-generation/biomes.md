## Sakura Groves

Inspired by the beautiful and worldwide-known sakura trees (or cherry blossoms), this flourishing pink and white biome is a peaceful home to the new [**sakura wood type**](../blocks.md#cherry-oak) and japanese-inspired natural decoration. üå∏

These biomes also feature a brand new soundtrack: ["**Brise couleur pastel**" by **LudoCrypt**](../soundtrack.md#brise-couleur-pastel).

This colorful forest is inspired by the greatest maple forests in the autumn season. Bees prefer living their life here for the coziness of the trees and the calm environment. When you strip a natural maple log, you have a 10% chance to find **syrup** drooling on its side. You can also transform maple logs into [**maple wood blocks**](../blocks.md#maple). üçÅ
