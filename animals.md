#### Details

A duck will have the appearance of a duckling when it is a child.

There are 2 variants of the duck:

* **Pekin** (`pekin`): Spawns in plains and forests.
* **Mallard** (`mallard`): Spawns in plains, rivers and swamps.

These types are stored in the duck's NBT tag (for example: `{Type: "mallard"}`)

You can always disable their natural spawning in the mod's configuration.
