The biggest (and cutest!) **rodent** of the planet is in **Promenade**.

This rather smelly animal will spawn in **swamps** and **rivers**. You may also encounter babies, which have their own set of cute sounds. They currently eat **carrots** and **melon slices**.

Talking of sounds, capybaras will be the very first mob of the game (and the mob) to be able to... **fart**... You've read that right...

Occasionally, they will let their fat body fall on the side and start **sleeping**. If they fall asleep during night, they will only wake up at **dawn**.

#### Details

There are 2 variants of the capybara:

* **Brown** (`promenade:brown`)
* **Albino** (`promenade:albino`)

These variants are stored in the capybara's NBT tag (for example: `{Variant: "promenade:brown"}`)

The ducks are webbed birds that fall slower than other animals, but swim better than most of them. They like to eat seeds. It will drop feathers and duck food upon dying. ðŸ¦†
